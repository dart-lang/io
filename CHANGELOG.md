## 0.3.1

- Added `SharedStdIn.nextLine` (similar to `readLineSync`) and `lines`:

```dart
main() async {
  // Prints the first line entered on stdin.
  print(await sharedStdIn.nextLine());
  
  // Prints all remaining lines.
  await for (final line in sharedStdIn.lines) {
    print(line);
  }
}
```

## 0.3.0

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: The `arguments` argument to `ProcessManager.spawn` is
  now positional (not named) and required. This makes it more similar to the
  built-in `Process.start`, and easier to use as a drop in replacement:

```dart
main() {
  processManager.spawn('dart', ['--version']);
}
```

- Fixed a bug where processes created from `ProcessManager.spawn` could not
  have their `stdout`/`stderr` read through their respective getters (a runtime
  error was always thrown).

- Added `ProcessMangaer#spawnBackground`, which does not forward `stdin`.

- Added `ProcessManager#spawnDetached`, which does not forward any I/O.

- Added the `shellSplit()` function, which parses a list of arguments in the
  same manner as [the POSIX shell][what_is_posix_shell].
